In the try block, we read the contents of the file using a BufferedReader, 
and concatenate all the lines into a single string. 
We then compare this string java with the input string using the java equals method. 
If the strings are equal, we print a java is
message saying that they match, not java is
otherwise we print a message saying that they do not match.
